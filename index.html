            <p>I've been going to Miyabi Sushi for many years with my family, especially on special occassions. Here is a small list of my favorite sushi rolls on their menu:</p>

                <li>Dancing Albacore</li>
                <li>Sex On The Beach</li>

                The interior of Miyabi Sushi is sleek with subtle Japanese design accents in the wall frames and tables.
                It's very conservative and subdued in comparison to your typical local Asian diner.
                You'll find no chopstick fonts and minimal usage of red in here.

                Well, my verdict is that this is good stuff and if you're looking to try some sushi, Miyabi Sushi is a solid place to start.
